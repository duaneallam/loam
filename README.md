# Loam Coding Challenge

Simple rendering of geojson example file in with maplibre, vue and vite

Very lightweight, should work out of the box, just install and run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Click on paddocks in each map for detail on each paddock.

Features in geoJSON are grouped by project name and summarised in a table below map

colour pallette inspiration from https://coolors.co/e7c736-f17105-d11149-6610f2-1a8fe3 the number of colours matching the number of projects and the "cool" and "warm" colours grouped by paddock owner is a happy little accident.
